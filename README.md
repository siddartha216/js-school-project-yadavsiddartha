# Timeline Project

## Stage 2 Description

HTML and CSS. It includes:

A stylish header with a logo and a call-to-action button

A vertical timeline with alternating event blocks and marker dots

A modal pop-up (hidden by default) for future use

A minimal, centered footer

The design uses Flexbox, media queries, and clean CSS practices to ensure the layout is responsive across all screen sizes â€” mobile, tablet, and desktop.
